Home Assistant custom component for monitoring and preventing cross-charging between batteries in dual-inverter setups.

Repository: `MJP-76/ha-dual-battery-control`

HACS-compatible metadata is included at the repository root in `hacs.json`.
The integration can create a Lovelace dashboard automatically from the entities you choose during setup, with separate battery blocks and live SOC/power trend cards.
It is configured through Home Assistant's UI config flow, not `configuration.yaml`.
Current release: `0.3.3`.
Default dashboard URL path: `dualbatterycontrol`.

## Background

This component was created to solve cross-charging between two batteries connected to a pair of **SolaX SKU-5000E inverters** that do not support Master/Slave co-ordination. In such setups each inverter independently decides when to charge or discharge its battery, which can lead to one battery discharging into the other — wasting energy and reducing efficiency. Dual Battery Control detects this condition and can automatically adjust charge current limits to break the loop.

## Included

- `custom_components/dual_battery_control/`
- battery registry
- rule engine (cross-charge, SOC divergence, thermal)
- correction engine — automatic prevention of cross-charging
- diagnostics
- repairs helper
- manifest and packaging metadata
- tests
- config flow and options flow for selecting battery entities, dashboard, and correction settings
- WhatsApp notifications when cross-charge corrections are applied
- enhanced correction history with amps, action type, and new limit per event
- dashboard control entities (switch, number, select) for auto-correction, check interval, and correction mode
- auto-calculated aggressiveness based on cross-charge severity
- two services: `prevent_cross_charge` (manual trigger with dry-run mode) and `set_auto_correction` (toggle)
